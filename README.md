# The Minion Game
[The Minion Game from HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-minion-game/problem). For [The Stupid Way](https://github.com/xga0/TheMinionGame/blob/master/The%20Minion%20Game%20-%20Stupid%20Way.py), we actually simulated the entire game process. Although this method can get the correct answer, if the input is a very long string, it will cause the runtime error. For [The Smart Way](https://github.com/xga0/TheMinionGame/blob/master/The%20Minion%20Game%20-%20Smart%20Way.py), We found the pattern of the final score calculation based on the example. Finally, we can use very simple codes to achieve the required functions.
